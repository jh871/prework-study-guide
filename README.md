# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project is a prework study guide that shows what I have learned in prework for front-end web dev bootcamp, including HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. 
I learned some basics about each of these languages while building the guide, and some of what I learned is listed within the guide.

## Installation

## Usage

The prework study guide can be opened in any browser. The guide has a section each for HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Each section contains notes about the topic. 
Additionally the user can open the DevTools console panel (on Windows: Ctrl+Shift+i) to see a list of the topics covered in prework and a suggestion of what topic to study first (if the user doesn't like the topic, they can just refresh the page - the console text will randomly suggest a new one!).
